<h2>What Is NSI-189 Free Base?</h2>
<p>NSI-189 is a research compound originally developed to boost neurogenesis in the hippocampus. As a free base powder, it dissolves easily in water or PG (propylene glycol) for flexible dosing. It’s a nootropic that aims to improve:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Memory enhancement</li>
  <li>Mood stability</li>
  <li>Focus and drive</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
